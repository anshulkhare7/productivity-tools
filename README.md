# My Productivity Tools

## Ditto

Ditto is an extension to the standard windows clipboard. It has a quick and easy interface to search through your clipboard items. Available for Windows only.

## Anki 

Anki is an intelligent flash card program that makes remembering things easy. It's based on the idea of [spaced-repetition](https://ncase.me/remember/). Though using someone else's Anki decks isn't much useful but I am sharing mine just in case you want to have a look.

Anki is available on Mac, Windows, Android and iOS.

## Self Control (Mac)

It allows you to keep the distraction away. Currently available for only Mac.

## Tiddly Wiki

Note taking software. It's like a quine - a self replicating html file - with a rich library of plugins. I use it to host my [notes](https://notes.anshulkhare.in/) as static website on github.

## Vimium

Chrome plugin for mouse(touchpad)-free browsing. You can pretty much do everything on a browser with keyboard shortcuts.

## Auto Hot Key

Very useful tool for automating stuff in windows. I primarily use for remapping keyboard keys and custom shortcuts etc. [My autohotkey scripts](https://github.com/anshulkhare7/productivitytools/blob/main/key-remapping.ahk)
