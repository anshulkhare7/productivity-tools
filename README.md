# My Productivity Tools

## Ditto

Ditto is an extension to the standard windows clipboard. It has a quick and easy interface to search through your clipboard items. Available for Windows only.

## Browser plugins

* Firefox plugin [Multi account containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) lets you segregate the browser tabs into isolated instances (color coded, custom names and rules for associating websites). Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously.

* [Temporary containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/) allow you to create disposable containers (unlike multi accoutn container which are pre-defined). Saves you the trouble of clearing local storage everytime.

* Chrome/Firefox plugin [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) is for mouse-free browsing. You can pretty much do everything on a browser with keyboard shortcuts.

## Anki 

Anki is an intelligent flash card program that makes remembering things easy. It's based on the idea of [spaced-repetition](https://ncase.me/remember/). Though using someone else's Anki decks isn't much useful but I am sharing mine just in case you want to have a look.

* [Multidisciplinary mental models.](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1729819997)

Anki is available on Mac, Windows, Android and iOS.

## Self Control (Mac)

It allows you to keep the distraction away. Currently available for only Mac.

## Tiddly Wiki

Note taking software. It's like a quine - a self replicating html file - with a rich library of plugins. I use it to host my [notes](https://notes.anshulkhare.in/) as static website on github.

## Auto Hot Key

Very useful tool for automating stuff in windows. I primarily use for remapping keyboard keys and custom shortcuts etc. [My autohotkey scripts](https://github.com/anshulkhare7/productivitytools/blob/main/key-remapping.ahk)
